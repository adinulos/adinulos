### Hi I'm Annika ðŸ‘‹

I am a data analytics student with a background in biology and neuroscience. My passion for understanding the complexity of the human brain and its behavior has led me to pursue a career in data analytics where I can leverage my skills to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. As I pursued my bachelor's degree at Loyola Marymount University, I developed a strong foundation in scientific research, experimental design and analysis. As a data analytics student, I am honing my skills in data wrangling, data visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning. I am excited to apply these skills to solve real-world problems, drive meaningful insights, and contribute to the field of data science.
